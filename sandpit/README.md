## Question 1

Create a program that reads the text file “raw_text.txt” , encrypts its contents using a simple encryption method, and writes the encrypted text to a new file “encrypted_text.txt” .

Create a function to decrypt the content, and a function to check the correctness of decrypted text.

### Requirements

- Read contents of text file "raw_text.txt"
- Encrypt text by shifting the letters forward by 1.
- If the letter is 'z' make it 'a' or if the letter is 'Z' make it 'A'
- Special characters, and numbers remain unchanged.
- Write encrypted text to file "encrypted_text.txt"
